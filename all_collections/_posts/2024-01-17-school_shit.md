Things here usually have a bit of backstory, and they aren't good. If you're ready for the negativity incoming, welcome. If you're not, I don't freaking care, strap in.

Most of them originate from me being the IT guy in the class and I needed to solve problems.

**Service Period:** 2021~2022  
This page was created as an index to search for answers that were supposed to be announced on our LINE group. Since LINE is terrible and makes files expire, I figured to use my FTP account to store them. This way classmates can access anywhere.

## 106 Class Website (Unhinged)

It's our class website, and we wanted to make it the flashiest it's ever been, being inspired by a lot of excellent demonstrations ever since 2018.  
Unfortunately, up to this point, the competition was on the brink of death. There were only three participants in total. It's genuinely disheartening to see that it hasn't been what it once was.  
If I recall correctly, the competition was ended following the shutdown of the school's FTP server in 2023, marking its death at 30-something years old.
- Very cool JavaScript and CSS used in many unexpected ways I guess
- Unhinged text job by lovely "Fan" (Nickname), I restored this version simply because you don't see people this honest anymore
- The website counter accumulates visits ever since the website was up in 2022 up until now

This is set up as an index to browse online class recordings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recordings were hosted on Google Drive, but removed in 2024 due to updated storage constraints to 20 GB (f*ck G Suite).  
- Based on the [Answer Search project](../../{{site.baseurl}}/answer/index.html)  
- Light/Dark Mode support
- Very poor password protection because everything is f*cking front-end
- Password lock after 5 incorrect attempts until cleared Cookies
