I am a freaking Taipei boy, so expect most of this to be related to the Taipei MRT. There's still a lot I wanted to do here, so stay tuned? 

## Taipei Metro PDP Mockup
[Link here](../../{{site.baseurl}}/testmrt.html)  
![Taipei Metro PDP Mockup](../../{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mrt_shit/pdp_old.png)
This is my first attempt at recreating the information display, you know, the TVs that show the estimated time for the next train.
- The data is made up
- It is set up to **1366 x 768**, the resolution of the screen of my computer when I started this
- I took all the pictures
- The news text are made up as well
- The [Maokong Gondola](https://www.gondola.taipei/) info was correct at the time, but I don't know now

## [WIP] Taipei Metro PDP (New)

As title says, this is a revision to the previous PDP. A lot has changed, as detailed below:
- Added URL parameters for extensibility 
- Supports Multi-lingual (ZH/EN/JP/KR) text
- Forces 16:9 aspect ratio
- Auto resets ETA
- Has some scaling issues, still figuring out
- **TODO:** Implement preferences to adjust settings
- **TODO:** Video player
- **TODO:** Actual functioning news marquee?

## [DEPRECATED] Taipei Metro App Revamp Project
[Link here](../../{{site.baseurl}}/MetroTestArea/index.html)   
![Taipei Metro App Revamp Project](../../{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mrt_shit/app.png)  
This is created to fix the shitty app interface Taipei Metro once used. Now they've come up with a new one which isn't great but is better.
- Material Design 2-ish
- Cool fonts bro
- Except for the main page, the rest are non-functional
- As stated, since the app is updated this will no longer be worked on

## Taipei Metro Station Announcements

- Includes all Taipei Metro Stations (and Circular Line)
- Will continue to be updated as new stations open
- Includes some common publicity matters
- **New:** Escalator Announcments and a new Home

As you can probably tell, this is much more primitive than it's Taipei counterpart. I've been there once in 2021 so these are left in 2021 as is. A lot has changed since then so this is just for archiving I guess.
- Includes all Taichung Metro stations (Line 1 / Green Line)
- Includes some publicity matters
- May not update until Blue Line opens?

Huh? Surprised there wasn't more? More is on the way!
