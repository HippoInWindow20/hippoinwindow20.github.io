  <h2>This design is very pretty and I like it.</h2>
  <br>
  <p style='font-weight: 500'>I tried designing my old site for years writing in pure HTML and I hated it. So eventually I resorted to using someone else's design and looks 10x better than what I have ever done.</p>
  <br>
  <p style='font-weight: 500'>So yes, this is the new look of my homepage. The old stuff are still here, looking as shitty as always.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Enjoy your stay.</h3>
  <br>
  <p style='font-weight: 500'>If you want the old homepage, <a href='index_old.html'>here it is.</a></p>
